# Data Annotation Portfolio Project

This repository showcases my skills in high-accuracy image annotation, a fundamental step in building reliable AI models.

## Project Overview

This self-initiated project involved performing precise bounding box annotation on a dataset of urban street images to identify vehicles. This demonstrates my ability to follow complex instructions and my meticulous attention to detail.

### Tools Used
